## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 12.0.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>= 6.0.0) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you prefer using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

To start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode with hot module replacement enabled. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build` / `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview` / `yarn preview`

Locally preview the production build.

### `npm run lint` / `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint to analyze your code for potential issues and enforce coding standards.
